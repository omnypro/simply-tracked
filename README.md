# Simply Tracked

This script is designed to track checkpoints reached in a given FireRed IronMON run. 

It was created with the intent of consolidating manually tracked data, whose collection began before custom extensions were available in the tracker. As such the checkpoints are customized to [my own](https://twitch.tv/avalonstar) runs. Checkpoints for each of the rival battles, the first trainer in Viridian Forest, and the non-gym Giovanni battles are included in addition to the standard gym leaders and Elite Four.

For now, the resulting CSV file is meant to be consumed by external programs.
